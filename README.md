# Summary

**What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code? How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**

Among the advantages of refactoring the code is having 'better' code- cleaner, more efficient, legible code that is easier to maintain and continue working with. The ultimate goal is to have code that is easily scaleble to your data demands. One concern of refractoring code is the unknown implications it may have on the work flow if not properly tested- this testing requires time, which at times could be scarse or limited. 

Overall there are many advantages to using VBA. It easily lends itself to the automation repetitive and routine tasks, offers workbooks protection by reducing the use formulas used in Excel reports, and accesibility. On the inverse VBA can be difficult to trouble shoot and debug which ultimately limits its accessibilty/useability.
